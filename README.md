# Dependencies

- `java`: JDK, you can install it using [asdf-java](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java) plugin.
- `bash`, `curl`, `tar`: Generic POSIX utilities.
- `shasum`: Verify archive checksum.
- `mvn`: Maven, which is used for downloading cloud jars.

# Environment Variables

- `ASDF_SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION`: Set this environment variable to use custom hadoop version from the Spark archive download page, e.g. `ASDF_SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=3 asdf install spark 3.3.0`. By default, this plugin will pick the latest hadoop version from the archive page if this environment variable is not being set.
- `ASDF_SPARK_WITHOUT_HADOOP`: Set this environment variable to download spark binary archive without hadoop support, e.g. `ASDF_SPARK_WITHOUT_HADOOP=1 asdf install spark 3.3.0`. By default, this plugin will download spark archive with hadoop support if this environment variable is not being set.
- `ASDF_SPARK_SKIP_VERIFICATION`: Set this environment variable to skip archive checksum verification step, e.g. `ASDF_SPARK_SKIP_VERIFICATION=1 asdf install spark 3.3.0`. By default, this plugin will verify the archive checksum if this environment variable is not being set.
- `ASDF_SPARK_WITH_CLOUD_JARS`: Set this environment variable to add jars for cloud support, e.g. `ASDF_SPARK_WITH_CLOUD_JARS=1 asdf install spark 3.3.0`. Only supported with version >= 3.2.0.

# FAQ

## How to set `SPARK_HOME` environment variable?

You can set `SPARK_HOME` environment variable inside your shell configuration file. Currently, this plugin only supports `bash` and `zsh` shells. Please note that you must place below scripts after sourcing the asdf-vm since these scripts require `asdf where` command.

For `zsh`, please add this script inside your `.zshrc` file.

```shell
source ~/.asdf/plugins/spark/set-spark-home.zsh
```

For `bash`, please add this script inside your `.bashrc` file.

```shell
source ~/.asdf/plugins/spark/set-spark-home.bash
```
